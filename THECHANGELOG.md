1.35.0;

The Color Shift Speed between colors when Rainbow FPS is enabled is no longer dependent on the framerate
Rainbow FPS now actually works while in Rendering Mode
Removed the Combo rating sprites that were present in the files
Bot Energy Drain/Refill/Health Gain/Drain is no longer inconsistent across FPS (hopefully)
Several crashes were fixed
Fixed the Game Over Data not being updated
Fixed a somewhat bizarre bug where the game would crash when saving a modded note splash
Fixed some time bars showing only the bar even if the time bar type was set to a No Bar option
